# Statistical Learning - From confusion to clarity
## A compilation of insightful questions and answers in the journey of Statistical Learning.

The aim of this project will be to produce a compilation of questions and answers raised during the course of learning Statistical Learning (from ISLR by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani). What sort of questions? Those that might not be covered in the book itself and hopefully will lead to some valuable insight into the inner workings of the statistical learning methods.

### Organisation of the repository:
<ul>
  <li>The file <b>CompiledQuestionsAndAnswers.docx</b> will contain all the questions and answers. The questions will be divided topic-wise and the contents section will help the user to jump to the relevant questions. This file is the starting point for a user.</li>
  <li>The guide to the answer for each question will be given below the question. This answer might lead to a jupyter notebook, a stackoverflow question, a mdeium blog etc., which might be needed to explain the answer.</li>
  <li>The .ipynb notebooks for these answers will be found in <b>/AnswersAndDemos.</b></li>
  </ul>

Let the ride begin...
